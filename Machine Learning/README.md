# Miniproject: Machine Learning

Programming languages: **R** or **Python**

All projects which require Machine Learning training should do the following:

1. Sign up for Kaggle and start the Titanic challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Unsupervised machine learning approaches (see below). 
3. Create a classification model using Supervised machine learning approaches (see below). 
4. Refine the model until you have > 70% accuracy
5. Subit your final predictions to Kaggle and then send Henry your notebook. 

Depending on the projects you are interested in joining, you should spend more or less time on the following:

1. Unsupervised learning (e.g., dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, clustering, etc)
2. Supervised learning (e.g., Classification/Regression models, parameter tuning, cross-validation, etc)

DataCamp (https://learn.datacamp.com/) has several supervised/unsupervised machine learning courses for learning these approaches! If you don't have access yet, just let Henry know and he will add you to the group.
