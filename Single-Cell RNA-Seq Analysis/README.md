# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis

Suggested pre-requisites: [R Programming](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20Programming) [R for Data Science](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20for%20Data%20Science) and [RNA-Seq Analysis](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/RNA-Seq%20Analysis)

The purpose of this challenge is to complete a full scRNA-Seq analysis, including interpreting the results in a biological context. You should pretend that you are making a report that you want to show to a biomedical collaborator who does not know any bioinformatics. You should have an introduction in which you outline the research question, a results section in which you present your results, and a discussion section in which you interpret the results. It should be written in `RMarkdown` and formatted in an aesthetic way that is easy to follow. Here is an example of an aesthetic, easy-to-follow RMarkdown notebook: [here](https://static-html-pages.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/merck-project/RloopCorrelationSummary.html).
