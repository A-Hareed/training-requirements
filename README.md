# Mini-Projects for Training

This repository contains the instructions and data necessary for completing the training prerequisits for each project. Each folder is named after the training it provides -- complete the instructions in the README file within each relevant folder and then send Henry the results when you are done. 

If you run into any issues, feel free to reach out for help over Slack to the other students or to Henry. Once you complete training, please be available to help others! We cannot succeed without working together. 

For learning R and Python, you can use DataCamp (you should have access -- ask Henry if not). There are relevant courses covering all areas of training! Link: https://www.datacamp.com/
